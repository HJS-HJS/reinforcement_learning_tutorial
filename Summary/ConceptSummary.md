## 0. Reason Why Failed the Export
- Causal confusion
    - If cause and effect are not clear and there is room for confusion, learning may be difficult.
- Non-Markovian behavior
    - What happened in the past affects the present
    - Use sequence model (Transformers, LSTM cells, ...)
- Multimodal behavior
    - When the number of possible actions in a situation is diverse
    - Mixture of Gaussians $\sum_i w_i \mathcal{N}(\mu_i , \Sigma_i)$
    - Latent variable models
    - Diffusion models
